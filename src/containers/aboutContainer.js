            Hello, I am Herman, a full-stack developer based in San Francisco!
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a big believer in being a lifelong learner. I love learning new
            technologies and applying what I learn by building projects. What I
            love most about programming is it pushes my mind to the absolute
            limits! I love the struggle and find it super rewarding when I
            figure something out through trial and error. I have a strong
            passion for building web applications from the ground up from design
            to development.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hobbies include cooking healthy recipes, long drives, reading
            self-improvement books, learning new technologies, and working out.
            I have recently started to integrate mediation into my morning
            routine as well!
          </p>
          <p>
            I am currently looking for work as a developer, so please feel free
            to
